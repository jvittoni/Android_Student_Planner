# University Capstone Project

### About:
This project was completed for the Software Engineering Capstone at my university. The mobile app is compatible with Android 8.0 and higher. It is a student planner app that allows users to track their classes and assignments. This Android app uses the Room Framework as an abstraction layer over the local SQLite database to save the data.
